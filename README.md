## Data Driven Business Recommendations
1) Since Thursday, Friday, and Saturday have the highest order volumes, ensure:
- Extra staff scheduled on these days.
- Increased inventory for top-selling ingredients.
- Prepare for peak hours (12 PM - 1 PM).

2) Promote Best-Selling Pizzas
- Run combo offers or loyalty programs featuring the Classic Deluxe and Barbecue Chicken pizzas.
- Upsell larger sizes (since "Large" size drives most revenue).

3) Improve Performance of Low-Selling Items
- Evaluate: Customer feedback , Pricing and Placement in menu for the Brie Carre Pizza
- Consider revising the recipe, bundling it, or replacing it with new offerings.

4) Menu Optimization Based on Category Performance
- Since Classic category drives highest orders , the other categories : Supreme, Veggie, and Chicken can be targeted with special promotions during non-peak days to balance sales.

5) Optimize Marketing Timing
- Schedule promotions and discounts before peak hours (e.g., 11 AM) to maximize lunchtime orders.
- Focus digital marketing on Thursday-Saturday to align with peak customer behavior.
